The major takeaway from this is that you can't beat yourself up for not knowing something already. There are so many properties and methods on prototypes, you cannot be expected to know them all from the getgo. In this particular exercise, some examples of this which will come in very handy are 'trasitionend' api, which occurs when a css transition has finished occuring, classList, which returns a list of classes on a node, currentTime on the audio node, which is very useful for setting events and returning the audio to start if some other event needs to occur instead. I'm excited about this. I'm already picking up more. This is a journey, you're not done when a class is finished...
