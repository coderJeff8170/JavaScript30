    //possibly the most difficult thing to undeerstand on this page, but very powerful - here, it will keep the length of the array to 13, removing the last item, every time a new character is added to 'pressed' once it reaches 13. So, it will remove index -14(the last index, and it will remove only one character)

      //very cool! join the array with no spaces, and find out if it includes a string...
