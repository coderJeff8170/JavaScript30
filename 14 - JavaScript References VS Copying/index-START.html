    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // remember, primitives are immutable!
    let age = 20; 
    let age2 = age;//age 2 is assigned the value of age at the time it is still 20;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 100;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age2=age;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const players2 = players;
    console.log(`players2: ${players2}`);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    players2[3] = 'jeff';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(`players: ${players}`);//uh oh! updates the original too, unlike with primitive varible!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const players3 = players.slice();//slice returns a copied portion of an array, but without params it'll return a copy of the entire array.
    console.log(`players3: ${players3}`);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const players4 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(`players4: ${players4}`);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const players5=[...players];
    console.log(`players5: ${players5}`);
    // of Array.from:
    const players6=Array.from(players);
    console.log(`players6: ${players6}`);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    players6[3] = 'bob';
    console.log(`players6: ${players6}`);
    console.log(`players: ${players}`);


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const jeff = person;
    jeff.number = 666;
    console.log(person);// jeff references person, so it adds a new property to person

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const sophia = Object.assign({}, person, {name: 'Sophia', age: 13, number: 42} );
    console.log(sophia);//how very cool.

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    //lets see if anythings changed since wes did his thang..
    const jennifer = {...person};
    jennifer.age = 30;
    jennifer.name = 'jennifer';
    console.log(jennifer);// how cool, they added it!!!
    

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const jeffrey = {
      name: 'Jeff',
      age: 49,
      social: {
        twitter: '@jefbot',
        facebook: 'pbj.developer'
      }
    };

    const dev = Object.assign({}, jeffrey);// you only avoid referencing 'jeffrey' on that first level - the nested obj. 'social' will be updated on the original if you update it's info in the clone - this is known as shallow cloning.
    console.log(dev);
    // you can cheat a deep clone using the JSON object as follows, but if you have a lot of information it will cause performance issues.
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(jeffrey));

    dev2.social.twitter = 'I changed only in the cloned object!'

    console.log(dev2);
