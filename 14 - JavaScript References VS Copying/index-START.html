    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // remember, primitives are immutable!
    let age = 20; 
    let age2 = age;//age 2 is assigned the value of age at the time it is still 20;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 100;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age2=age;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const players2 = players;
    console.log(players2);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    players2[3] = 'jeff';
    console.log(players);//uh oh! updates the original too, unlike with primitive varible!
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const players3 = players.slice();//slice returns a copied portion of an array, but without params it'll return a copy of the entire array.
    console.log(players3);
    const players4 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(players4);
    const players5=[...players];
    console.log(players5);
    const players6=Array.from(players);
    console.log(`players6: ${players6}`);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
